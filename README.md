## Exercise 1: Inheritance and Polymorphism

Create a base class called Vehicle with attributes brand and year, along with a method description() that prints out information about the vehicle. Then, create two subclasses Car and Motorcycle that inherit from Vehicle. Override the description() method in both subclasses to provide specific information about each type of vehicle.

## Exercise 2: Abstraction and Encapsulation

Design an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area(). Create three subclasses: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each implementing the area() method. Each shape should have attributes (like radius, length, width, base, height) necessary to calculate its area. Use encapsulation to control access to these attributes.

## Exercise 3: Polymorphism

Create a base class Animal with a method speak(). Derive subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Cow. Implement the speak() method in each subclass to return the appropriate sound the animal makes. Create a function that takes a list of Animal objects and demonstrates polymorphism by having each animal in the list speak.

## Exercise 4: Inheritance and Encapsulation

Design a class Person with attributes name and age. Derive a class Student from Person, adding an attribute student_id. Implement getters and setters to encapsulate access to these attributes. Create an instance of Student and demonstrate the use of getter and setter methods.

## Exercise 5: Abstraction and Inheritance

Create an abstract class BankAccount with methods deposit() and withdraw(). Derive two classes, SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, from it. Implement the methods in each subclass with specific behavior. Make sure to handle cases where withdrawals might lead to a negative balance for the CheckingAccount.

## Exercise 6: Encapsulation and Polymorphism

Design a class Employee with attributes name, salary, and role. Use encapsulation to ensure the salary attribute is not accessible directly. Derive two subclasses Manager and Developer. Implement the get_bonus() method in each subclass that calculates a bonus based on the role. Demonstrate polymorphism by calculating and printing bonuses for different types of employees.
